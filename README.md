# Discord-Bot
General bot for fun stuff

Bot currently uses the commands
        !updatenick (summoner name) - takes a summoner names and changes the discord user to their rank and lp, teases iron players
        !helpritonamer - displays help for using the bot

Make sure the role that the bot is apart of is at the top of the roles hierarchy so
it can change everyones nicknames
